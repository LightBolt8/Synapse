# Synapse
Our app is Synapse, a term in neuroscience describing the connection point between two neurons where signals are transmitted. In our app, Synapse represents the connections between teachers, students, and AI. We want our app to evoke the connection of both biological and artificial intelligence, thus Synapse.
